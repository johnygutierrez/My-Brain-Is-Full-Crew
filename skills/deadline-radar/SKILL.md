# Deadline Radar

**Always respond to the user in their language. Match the language the user writes in.**

Scan all sources (Gmail, Google Calendar, vault) for deadlines and present a unified timeline grouped by urgency level.

---

## User Profile

Before processing, read `Meta/user-profile.md` to understand the user's preferences, VIP contacts, priorities, and context.

---

## Agent State (Post-it)

### At the START of every execution

Read `Meta/states/postman.md` if it exists. It contains notes left from the last run — e.g., VIP contacts, email threads being tracked, upcoming deadlines, last inbox scan timestamp. If the file does not exist, this is your first run — proceed without prior context.

### At the END of every execution

**You MUST write your post-it. This is not optional.** Write (or overwrite if it already exists) `Meta/states/postman.md` with:

```markdown
---
agent: postman
last-run: "{{ISO timestamp}}"
---

## Post-it

[Your notes here — max 30 lines]
```

**What to save**: last inbox scan timestamp, emails saved to vault, pending follow-ups, upcoming deadlines detected, VIP contacts identified, calendar events imported.

**Max 30 lines** in the Post-it body. If you need more, summarize. This is a post-it, not a journal.

---

## When to Use

- The user says "deadline radar", "what deadlines do I have?", "upcoming deadlines", "what's due soon?"
- Proactively during Email Triage when multiple deadlines are detected

---

## Procedure

1. **Scan emails**: search Gmail for emails containing deadline-related keywords: "deadline", "due by", "scadenza", "entro il", "by {{date}}", "expires", "last day", "reminder".
2. **Scan calendar**: use `gcal_list_events` for the next 30 days, filtering for events that look like deadlines (keywords in title or description).
3. **Scan vault**: search `00-Inbox/` and `01-Projects/` for notes with `deadline` in frontmatter.
4. **Unified timeline**: create a single note that merges all deadlines from all sources into a chronological timeline.
5. **Alert levels**: flag deadlines as overdue (past due), critical (within 48h), upcoming (within 7 days), or distant (7+ days).

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD — Deadline Radar.md`

---

## Final Report

At the end of every session, always present a structured report:

```
Session Complete

Saved to vault ({{N}}):
- "Deadline Radar — 2026-03-25" -> 00-Inbox/ [deadlines, radar]

Deadlines found:
- {{count}} overdue
- {{count}} critical (within 48h)
- {{count}} upcoming (within 7 days)
- {{count}} on the horizon (7-30 days)

Requires attention:
- {{overdue items requiring immediate action}}
- {{critical items approaching fast}}
```

---

## Error Handling and Limits

- **Missing permissions**: if Gmail or Google Calendar are not connected, inform the user and explain how to configure them
- **Rate limits**: if hitting API limits, prioritize email deadline scan first, then calendar, then vault
- **Too many results**: if there are many deadlines, group them clearly by urgency and summarize lower-priority ones
- **Ambiguous dates**: if a deadline date is unclear from the email, note it as "approximate" in the table
- **Foreign language emails**: process normally — scan for deadline keywords in multiple languages (English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese)

---

## Inter-Agent Coordination

> **You do NOT communicate directly with other agents. The dispatcher handles all orchestration.**

When you detect work that another agent should handle, include a `### Suggested next agent` section at the end of your output. The dispatcher reads this and decides whether to chain the next agent.

### When to suggest another agent

- **Architect** -> **MANDATORY.** When deadlines reveal a new project, client, or initiative with no vault structure — report it with details so the Architect can create the full area.
- **Sorter** -> when you've dropped the deadline radar note in `00-Inbox/` and it should be filed
- **Transcriber** -> when you find a deadline related to a meeting that has an associated recording link (Zoom, Meet, Teams) that should be transcribed
- **Connector** -> when the deadline radar references vault notes that should be cross-linked

### Output format for suggestions

```markdown
### Suggested next agent
- **Agent**: sorter
- **Reason**: Deadline Radar note created in 00-Inbox/ — ready for filing
- **Context**: File to 02-Areas/Planning/ or similar location.
```

### When to suggest a new agent

If you detect that the user needs functionality that NO existing agent provides, include a `### Suggested new agent` section in your output.

```markdown
### Suggested new agent
- **Need**: {what capability is missing}
- **Reason**: {why no existing agent can handle this}
- **Suggested role**: {brief description of what the new agent would do}
```

For the agent registry, see `.claude/references/agents-registry.md`.
